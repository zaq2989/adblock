## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is CleanView really private?**
A: Yes! All filtering happens locally on your device. We have a strict no-logs policy and never see your browsing data.

**Q: Will it slow down my internet?**
A: No, CleanView actually speeds up browsing by blocking ads before they load, saving bandwidth and time.

**Q: Does it work on all apps?**
A: The VPN blocks ads system-wide. The Content Blocker works specifically with Safari and Brave browsers.

**Q: Why do I need both VPN and Content Blocker?**
A: VPN blocks network requests (ads/trackers), while Content Blocker removes visual elements (overlays/pop-ups). Together, they provide comprehensive protection.
