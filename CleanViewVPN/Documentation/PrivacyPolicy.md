# CleanView Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2024**

## Our Commitment

CleanView is designed with privacy as our foundation. We believe in protecting your digital privacy without compromising your personal data.

## Core Principles

### No-Logs Policy
We maintain a strict no-logs policy:
- **No browsing history** - We never track websites you visit
- **No connection logs** - We don't record connection times or durations
- **No IP addresses** - Your real IP address is never stored
- **No DNS queries** - Your DNS requests remain private
- **No personal data** - We don't collect names, emails, or identifiers

## What We Process (Not Store)

### Local Processing Only
- **DNS Filtering**: Domain blocking happens locally on your device
- **Content Blocking**: CSS rules are applied locally in your browser
- **Whitelist**: Your whitelisted sites stay on your device only

### Anonymous Statistics
To improve our service, we collect minimal anonymous data:
- Total number of ads/trackers blocked (no specifics)
- App crash reports (automatically anonymized by Apple)
- Subscription status (managed by Apple)

## Data Security

### Encryption
- All network traffic uses industry-standard encryption
- Local data is protected by iOS security features

### Third-Party Services
- **Apple App Store**: Handles subscriptions and payments
- **No Analytics Services**: We don't use Google Analytics or similar
- **No Ad Networks**: Our app contains no advertisements

## Your Rights

### Data Control
- All filtering happens on your device
- You can delete the app to remove all local data
- Whitelist can be exported/imported at any time

### Transparency
- Our blocking rules are visible and modifiable
- You control which domains to whitelist
- VPN connection is always under your control

## Children's Privacy
CleanView does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app functions entirely locally without requiring personal information.

## Legal Compliance

### Lawful Use
CleanView is designed for legitimate privacy protection and improved browsing experience. Users must comply with local laws and regulations.

### International Users
As we don't collect personal data, there are no international data transfers.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect app improvements. The "Last Updated" date will change accordingly.
